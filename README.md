Studio Ghibli API Application

Welcome!  This ruby application will reach out to a Studio Ghibli film database and supply you with a full list of their movies.  From there, you'll have the opportunity to learn more about each title, and the option to store them in your own 'playlist'.


Usage
-----

To begin, open up the project repository in your development environment.  Ensure you change to the proper directory by entering:

cd studio_ghibli_api_app

Once here, you can run the application by entering:

ruby bin/run

This will bring you to the main menu.  Follow the on screen prompts to navigate the application.
